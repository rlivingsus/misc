### Payments  
-Copay is a flat fee that you pay on the spot each time you go to your doctor or fill a prescription.  Don't necessarily pay this all the time some plans use both copays and deductible/coinsurance.  
-Deductible is the amount you pay each year for most eligible medical services or medications before your health plan begins to share in the cost of covered services.  EG. If you have a $2000 yearly deductible, you need to pay the first $2000 of your total eligible medical costs before your plan helps to pay.
-Medical issues so lower deducible and higher premiums best.
-Coinsurance is a portion of the medical cost you pay after your deductible has been met.  
-Out-of-Pocket maximum is the most you could pay for covered medical expenses in a year.  This includes money you spend on deductibles, copays, and coinsurance.
