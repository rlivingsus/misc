### 12.21.21 Telecon with Lincoln Smith PAC
-update my medical and optionally vitamins in mychart\
-Issues (more hardening or calcification or buildup) could be due to pre-diabetes or genetics.  Lincoln will reach out to Dr. Penn for an APO or Apple B check.  Calcification works on the outside and then moves inwards.  Early stage is soft.\
-Blockage ~60% cannot be opened up with stent until 80-90%\
-Concerns with kidney injury, radiation for angiogram & message below  
-HbA10 hemaglobin test every 6 months if you have diabetes.  Lincoln thanks for the message you left on my phone.  I do have a question, Am I considered disabled or do I have a disability?  I notice this is a question listed in job applications with heart disease listed   

### 12 2021 Notes and Questions put together for Lincoln (which some not really answered)
-Three main arteries in the heart with Right Coronary Artery (RCA) my issue and Left Coronary Artery to 2?  Left Anterior Descending Artery (LAD) aka _**Widowmaker**_  
-Qs to ask:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Am I considered disabled? I didn't ask but more or less said I could jog.  Said I wasn't restricted from travel for work  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Using CT scans for checking arteries but said depending on situation.  I guess catheterization is better except for kidney issues and radiation as mentioned above  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-I mentioned that my LDL is low but HDL constantly low.  I eat fish, exercise, and not overweight  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-I mentioned maybe residual plaque moving through body after new meds maybe that is why new build up but no answer to this  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Ask if jogging is OK and probably but Lincoln will follow up with Dr. Penn
