### 2.4.22 Seattle Times article about Cody Pickett regarding heart disease  
-41 yr.  Started with coronary calcium scan -an x-ray test that detects calcium-containing plaque in the arteries.  Good to help DRs. ID coronary artery disease before onslaught signs and symptoms.  A score between 100 and 300 indicates moderate plaque deposits with relative high risk over the next three to five years.  Cody's score was 1600.    
-Next a CT scan followed by a coronary angiogram.    
-Dr. Bill Lombardi at UW Medical Center one of the best in the country at placing coronary stents.  May be a solution other than open heart surgery.

Elevated Lipoprotein(a): Is it a Long-Sought Treatment Finally on the Way?  
-Lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a) is a distinctive particle with two components: a lipoprotein core that resembles LDL, along with a shell that contains apolipoprotein(a) or apo(a).    
-Elevated blood **Lp(a)** levels are primary due to genetic variations in the LPA gene that encodes for apo(a) and cannot be lowered by diet, exercise, or current lipid-lowering therapies.  
-Culprit for therapy with statins or other lipid lowering medications.  The **culprit** is a very high level of Lp(a)  
-Normal Lp(a) considered to be less than 25 mg/dL with significant risk of atherothrombotic events begin at levels between 50 and 70 mg/dL.  
-Some statins can actually slightly raise Lp(a) levels.  
-**Approach that furthest along involves antisense oligonucleotide **(ASO)** therapy.  Focus of newly launched international phase 3 trial with Cleveland Clinic.  
-Participants will have established coronary artery disease and fall into >= 70 mg/dL and >= 90 mg/dL  
-study completion expected at 2024.

### 1.26.22 Talked Joel UW Pulmonary  
-He said it's not showing up in my record and usually does if receive a referral so make sure using correct numbers

-Told Pam that I didn't hear back regarding a Lipid test referral and potential shot  
-The notes we're "Lipid clinic referral for rapid advancing coronary disease on maximum medical therapy"  
-Could not reach Pulmonary dept. so Pam sent a note with my record #U5500229 & Referral FAX # 206.598.3621

### 12.21.21 Telecon with Lincoln Smith PAC
-update my medical and optionally vitamins in mychart\
-Issues (more hardening or calcification or buildup) could be due to pre-diabetes or genetics.  Lincoln will reach out to Dr. Penn for an APO or Apple B check.  Calcification works on the outside and then moves inwards.  Early stage is soft.\
-Blockage ~60% cannot be opened up with stent until 80-90%\
-Concerns with kidney injury, radiation for angiogram & message below  
-HbA10 hemaglobin test every 6 months if you have diabetes.  Lincoln thanks for the message you left on my phone.  I do have a question, Am I considered disabled or do I have a disability?  I notice this is a question listed in job applications with heart disease listed   

### 12 2021 Notes and Questions put together for Lincoln (which some not really answered)
-Three main arteries in the heart with Right Coronary Artery (RCA) my issue and Left Coronary Artery to 2?  Left Anterior Descending Artery (LAD) aka _**Widowmaker**_  
-Qs to ask:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Am I considered disabled? I didn't ask but more or less said I could jog.  Said I wasn't restricted from travel for work  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Using CT scans for checking arteries but said depending on situation.  I guess catheterization is better except for kidney issues and radiation as mentioned above  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-I mentioned that my LDL is low but HDL constantly low.  I eat fish, exercise, and not overweight  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-I mentioned maybe residual plaque moving through body after new meds maybe that is why new build up but no answer to this  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Ask if jogging is OK and probably but Lincoln will follow up with Dr. Penn
