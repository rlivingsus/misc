### 2.8.22 Search of "PCSK9 inhibitor medications" news articles    
-New treatments could help people hesitant towards statins.  "Do what statins couldn't".  Based on research of gene called PCSK9 new drug 2022.  People with non functioning PCSK9 gene have naturally low levels of unhealthy LDL cholesterol.  Previous targetted PCSK9 gene proved ineffective in 2015 due to high cost and the need for new injections at two week intervals.  New options cheaper: FDA gave approval for an RNA therapy that blocks the gene with a twice yearly injection and another blocks the protein with an oral pill.  Also CRISPR one dose therapy using a protein called Cas9.  
-Can statins cause type 2 diabetes?  
-Want PCSK9 inhibitors.  First PCSK9 inhibitor monoclonal antibodies called Repatha ($476 a month but can be cheaper, $60 bucks for 2 injectors) and Praluent (not covered by afspa, express scripts) were approved by FDA in 2015 but high cost and require self-injection every two weeks.  Now inhibitors being developed that could cost less act longer and maybe orally.  
-FDA approved Novartis Leqvio RNA therapy injected twice a year reduce LDL by 52% costs is $3250 per dose so $9759 in year one followed by $6500 each year after, 3 doses first year and 2 doses after that each year.  Merck&Co.'s MK-0616 peptide in phase 1 clinical trials can be oral.  Verve Therapeutics Verve-101 gene therapy can permanently maybe lower LDL with a single dose.  

### 2.5.22 Lipoprotein(a) notes from various  

-Lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a) is a protein that transports cholesterol in the blood.  An LDL particle. High levels of Lp(a) in the blood can increase the likelihood of plaques or blood clots forming in the arteries.  
-Lp(a) test is not a routine test.  Doc may ask for full lipid panel test which checks for cholesterol and triglyceride may ask for fast and only h20.  
-some say levels about 25-30 mg/dl may increase risk but definitely 50 mg/dl or >125 nmol/L.  Normal is under 25 or 30 or <75 nmol/L  
-How to reduce?  Usually genetics so hard.  Medications that inhibit **PCSK9** may reduce Lp(a) levels PCSK9 inhibitor MEDS new in 2015 shown to reduce but more study.  Lipoprotein apheresis is a procedure similar to dialysis.  A machine separates cholesterol from blood plasma and removes the Lp(a) and LDL cholesterol from the blood required weekly or biweekly.  Harborview Medical Center Apheresis Department per https://thefhfoundation.org/fh-treatments/lipoprotein-apheresis  
-Lp(a) test is usually done once, becuase it's pretty constant across your lifetime.  Some exceptions like after menopause cuz Lp(a) levels increase as estrogen levels drop (estrogen good to reduce Lp(a))  
-Supplements: Niacin or vitamin B3, CoQ10, Tumeric  
-Do I have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) too?  In 2020, number of Lp(a) lowering meds in clinical trials now and will see outcomes in next few years.  REF: https://thefhfoundation.org/lipoprotein-a-5-things  
-Lipoprotein(a) is a sticky version of LDL cholesterol which is genetic so cures for this is important.  L-Lysine and L-Proline bind to LP(a) to remove into liver so high vitamin C and amino acid lysine.  
-Heart general advice: avoid trans fat; reduce saturated fat, increase intake of fruits, vegetable, whole grains.  "Unfortunately, their conclusions, if taken to heart, leave consumers to rely on genetics and fate to avoid coronary heart disease - an unacceptable situation given the fact that the scientific literature contains so many studies that point to benefit for omega-3 fatty acids," MacKay said.  
-CT scan and calcium buildup bad  Prothrombin: Time test to see how long blood clots.  Inherited clotting tendencies.
Young heart attack or stroke may indicate the presence of THROMBOPHILIA.  The 2nd most common inherited version is referred to as Prothrombin Mutation via thrombophiliac.com/prothrombin-mutation.  *but maybe not the case cuz doesn't buildup? Next Anticoagulant aka blood thinners work by inhibiting clotting factors.  Antiplatelets inhibit enzymes that cause platelets to clump together.*

### 2.4.22 Seattle Times article about Cody Pickett regarding heart disease  
-41 yr.  Started with coronary calcium scan -an x-ray test that detects calcium-containing plaque in the arteries.  Good to help DRs. ID coronary artery disease before onslaught signs and symptoms.  A score between 100 and 300 indicates moderate plaque deposits with relative high risk over the next three to five years.  Cody's score was 1600.    
-Next a CT scan followed by a coronary angiogram.    
-Dr. Bill Lombardi at UW Medical Center one of the best in the country at placing coronary stents.  May be a solution other than open heart surgery.  
&  
Elevated Lipoprotein(a): Is it a Long-Sought Treatment Finally on the Way?  
-Lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a) is a distinctive particle with two components: a lipoprotein core that resembles LDL, along with a shell that contains apolipoprotein(a) or apo(a).    
-Elevated blood **Lp(a)** levels are primary due to genetic variations in the LPA gene that encodes for apo(a) and cannot be lowered by diet, exercise, or current lipid-lowering therapies.  
-Culprit for therapy with statins or other lipid lowering medications.  The **culprit** is a very high level of Lp(a)  
-Normal Lp(a) considered to be less than 25 mg/dL with significant risk of atherothrombotic events begin at levels between 50 and 70 mg/dL.  
-Some statins can actually slightly raise Lp(a) levels.  
-**Approach that furthest along involves antisense oligonucleotide **(ASO)** therapy.  Focus of newly launched international phase 3 trial with Cleveland Clinic.  
-Participants will have established coronary artery disease and fall into >= 70 mg/dL and >= 90 mg/dL  
-study completion expected at 2024.

### 1.26.22 Talked Joel UW Pulmonary  
-He said it's not showing up in my record and usually does if receive a referral so make sure using correct numbers  
-Pulmonary FAX again is 206.598.3621 BUT central coordinator who will forward to right place and is digital is 206.744.1999.  I can confirm by calling the Pulmonary dept. and choose "2" to get to the Pulmonary office  

### 1.11.22 Message from Sound Family Health  
-Nicole Waite stated that the initial referral was faxed on 11.30.21 but will resend on 1.11.22  

### 1.11.22 Called UW Medicine  
-Spoke to Aida and she talked to the Pulmonary dept. who said they did not receive a fax  
-Will let Dr. Hoffman know to send fax to 206.598.3621  

### 12.22.21 Called UW Medicine for referral  
-Called 206.598.4615 which is Pulmonary dept. per Pam.  Location is 1959 NE Pacific St.?    
-Told Pam that I didn't hear back regarding a Lipid test referral and potential shot  
-The notes we're "Lipid clinic referral for rapid advancing coronary disease on maximum medical therapy"  
-Could not reach Pulmonary dept. so Pam sent a note with my record #U5500229 & Referral FAX # 206.598.3621

### 12.21.21 Telecon with Lincoln Smith PAC
-update my medical and optionally vitamins in mychart\
-Issues (more hardening or calcification or buildup) could be due to pre-diabetes or genetics.  Lincoln will reach out to Dr. Penn for an APO or Apple B check.  Calcification works on the outside and then moves inwards.  Early stage is soft.\
-Blockage ~60% cannot be opened up with stent until 80-90%\
-Concerns with kidney injury, radiation for angiogram & message below  
-HbA10 hemaglobin test every 6 months if you have diabetes.  Lincoln thanks for the message you left on my phone.  I do have a question, Am I considered disabled or do I have a disability?  I notice this is a question listed in job applications with heart disease listed   

### 12 2021 Notes and Questions put together for Lincoln (which some not really answered)
-Three main arteries in the heart with Right Coronary Artery (RCA) my issue and Left Coronary Artery to 2?  Left Anterior Descending Artery (LAD) aka _**Widowmaker**_  
-Qs to ask:  
-Am I considered disabled? I didn't ask but more or less said I could jog.  Said I wasn't restricted from travel for work  
-Using CT scans for checking arteries but said depending on situation.  I guess catheterization is better except for kidney issues and radiation as mentioned above  
-I mentioned that my LDL is low but HDL constantly low.  I eat fish, exercise, and not overweight  
-I mentioned maybe residual plaque moving through body after new meds maybe that is why new build up but no answer to this  
-Ask if jogging is OK and probably but Lincoln will follow up with Dr. Penn
