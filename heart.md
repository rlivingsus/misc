### 5.15.22 Notes about CTO  

Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)  
- 7 common principles that widely accepted best practices:
-- Ischemic symptom improvement is the primary indication for CTO-PCI like strokes?
-- Dual coronary angiography (and, if available, coronary computed tomography angiography) are key for planning and safely performing CTO-PCI
-- Use of microcatheter is essential for optimal guidewire manipulation and exchanges
-- Antegrade wiring, antegrade dissection and reentry, retrograde approach are complementary and necessary crossing strategies
-- If initially selected crossing strategy fails alternative crossing technique increases the likelihood of eventual PCI success, shortens procedure time, and lower radiation and contrast use.
-- Specific CTO-PCI expertise and volume/availability of specialized equipement will increase likelihood of success and facilitate prevention and management of complications such as perforation
-- Attention to lesion preparation and stenting technique is required to ensure optimum stent expansion and minimize risk of short/long term adverse events
- evaluation of collateral circulation is critical for determining the feasibility of retrograde approach which differs from antegrade approach and occlusion is approached from the distal vessel

- CTOs are blockages that present for three months or more.  Blockages generally result of severe build-up of fatty deposits of plaque within the arteries (atherosclerosis) or fatty deposits
- Success rates approaching near 90%
- How Safe? Kidney damage elevated risk due to intravenous contrast use and bleeding at entry site into arteries in the groin.  Most other risks are similar to what is seen routine angioplasty and can include: bleeding at puncture site, damage to blood vessel at puncture site, sudden closure of the coronary artery, tear in inner lining of the artery, heart attack 
- partial success occurs sometime will be reattempted 6-8 weeks later
- 2 catheters are placed to go forward or backwards as needed.  

CTO: To treat or not to treat?  
- successful results improvement in patient symptoms, quality of life, left ventricular function, and survival.  Scientific evidence comes from observational studies (based on successful vs. unsuccessful cohorts) and no randomized study has yet been published. 
- tx for Angina should be treated, depends
- tx for Ischemia is restriction in blood supply
- tx for ventricular dysfunction
- patients should be selected very carefully, especially if they are asymptomatic or very few symptoms. and the benefits obtained in terms of complications during the procedure, the quality of life obtained and further ischemic events avoided should be evaluated systematically.

Ornish Diet?  
- conceived by Dean Ornish, MD restricts dietary fat severley (to less than 10% of daily calories) and all fats come from plant sources.
- Supposedly prevents CAD AND improves artery plaques.
- HOWEVER, clinical studies in which dietary fat was restricted to less than 25% of daily calories have failed to demonstrate a cardiovascular benefit.  The AHA once recommended a low-fat diet but has since change its guidelines.
- possibly good for weight loss but "should be regarded as an intriguing hypothesis"

### 4.19.22 Appointment with Mark Anstadt  

- meeting #2
- Labs #2 found.  LDL 59 where optimal is <70 ideal <50 (European standards).  I'm only on Atorvastatin.  Newer meds PCSK9 which isn't covered by insurance unless <70 LDL.
- New med Azetia? single pill once a day with or without pills.  Lower the LDL the better.
- LP(a) genetic in liver breaks down less LDL.  No medicine affects this (yet?).  Trials at end stage to be out in public in 2 or 3 years from closed.  Last phase now and Mark will check to see if I can be added.  Med: Pelicarson; study name: Heritage?/Horizon study.  ClinicalTrials.gov @ NIH
- Maybe PCSK9 ok in future if over 70 LDL
- My glucose levels are a bit high and statins that may cause it to elevate is usually at the beginning stages
- Talk to Dr. Hoffman about my A1C levels and maybe increase Jardiance to 2 10mg or 25mg a day also helps to reduce heart failure
- Change from carbs to healty fats/proteins.  
- 5 good grains or ancient grains: 1) Quinoa, 2) Buckwheat Grotes?, 3) Amaranth? seed with oatmeal, 4) Wheat berry (whole grain of wheat), 5) Millet aka bird seed.  See Splendid Grain book by Rebecca Wood
- Asked about low LDL affecting strokes and such.  Based on a single study.  My atheroschrosis and plaque issue is more critical than "rupture of plaque".  Newborns have 20s LDL and are OK.  Cells can make fats and such on it's own so we do not need fats in our bloodstream.  
- Regarding Cardiologist and Laser work on RCA with stent works on reactive vice preventive and how does the cure really affect/help me.
- Next appt. 3 months with lab draws again   

### 3.22 Dr. Calvin Yeang San Diego talk regarding lp(a)  

- 90% determined by Genes with kids 50% chance to inherit  
- LP(a) causal lifely of OxPL oxidized phospholipids pro inflamation and calcification  
- Coronary Calcium Score (CAC) lower is better for LP(a)  
- Statins can actually raise LP(a)  
- -Does Niacin reduce LP(a).  Yes but no benefit to CVD. Niacin 2g and Apheresis helps lower LP(a) however does it reduce CVD.  Wont know for a couple of years.  Pelacarsen and Olipasiran clinical trials.  Note that Niacin is linked to an increase risk of bleeding, diabetes, and death.  AKA Vitamin B3  
- Continue with healthy lifestyle/exercise, good body weight, non smoke, etc...  
- PCSK9 inhibitors can reduce LP(a) modestly  
- Lipoprotein Apheresis can reduce LP(a) ~70% but my LDL is ~60 when it needs to be above 100 for insurance to cover.  
- Does low carb diet reduce Lp(a)? possibly doesn't hurt to try :)  
- CRP testing? sensitive marker (someone recovering by cold can have elevation here)  

### 3.22.22 Notes and Dr. Penn and Lipid lab results   

Are all Fats Bad for You?
-Fats are essential: Omega3, monounsaturated fats good, reasonable of saturated fat in absence of reduced carbs diet (cuz react different with and without carbs),

Dr. Richard Lindquist from Swedish Med https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89sHwqB9PNc  

- Saturated fats are solid at room temperature found in butter, lard, full-fat milk/yogurt, full-fat cheese, high fat meat
- Unsaturated fat tends to be liquid at room temperature found in vegetable oils, fish and nuts
- AHA recommends staying under 7% of daily calories of saturated fat cuz tends to raise low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in blood.  
- Two types of unsaturated fats: 
-- monounsaturated found in olive, canola, peanut, sunflower, safflower oils, avocados, peanut butter and most nuts.  Also part of most animal fats like chicken, pork, beef.  
-- polyunsaturated fat found in sunflower, corn, soybean, and cottonseed oil also found in walnut, pine nuts, flaxseed, sesame, sunflower, and pumpkin seeds.  Omega 3 fall into this category and found in fatty fish like salmon, herring, sardines. 

REF: https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fat/art-20045550

- TRANS FAT is the worst and used to turn healthy oils into solid to prevent them from getting rancid.  No known health benefits.
- replace saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats like veggie oils or high-fiber carbs is good BUT replacing saturated fats with highly processed carbs could do the opposite.

L-lysine & L-proline binds to Lp(a) to remove to liver.  So high vitamin C and amino acid lysine is good  

Lipoprotein(a) aka little a per Dr. Penn?  

Met with Dr. Penn and Dr student on 3.22.22 and here are the items:  
- regarding the laser on the right (and maybe left).  We have a second appointment with Dr. Goleski? with Yuko and will need to update cuz the Thursday 4.2x is during early release for Sara.  Maybe dangerous procedure.  Still some nauseousness but better?
- Angiogram once a year?  Nope we wait until I start feeling worse then let them know so we do something (probably angiogram then).  I forgot to ask for non invasive like EKG.  Can live with how I am (plugged up RCA) but not right so probably should fix
- If I want to look at potential trials check with NP Marc? to reduce LP(a) but don't want to reduce LDL too much cuz Yuks says your arterial walls get weak and possible stroke and stuff.
- Next appt. 6-12 months.
----
### 2.25.22 Notes and Polyclinic video conference  

Appointment with PolyClinic, Mark Anstadt.
-Qs to send via MyChart or maybe next appointment.  Niacin OK to take?  Also is low LDL bad for making your arterial walls weak?  
-Insurance only covers shots for those with LDL above 70 so out of pocket $1500 per month  
-I'm one of the highest risk  
-guidelines are to check cholesterol at age of 9 or earlier for those with familial xxx   
-ask for pre Feb 2018 lab results  
-Apolipoprotein B or ApoB is a protein that plays a part in the development of heart disease and elevated blood levels of ApoB indicate an increased risk.  cannot treat but make LDL lower to help  
-Lipoprotein(A) too but this is probably normal.  No drugs too but there are items in development.  Family Heart article that I saved on gmail also mentioned elevated Lipo(a).  This is genetic and runs in families.  Can match up with LDL-C which is bad cholesterol but I don't have this too high.  
-I'll be getting an advanced LIPID panel checking 4 things.  Take a printout to Labcorp.  $120 and not covered by insurance usually  
-Also possibly genetic testing to get more information some even in the thousands but legality concerns due to health insurance and life insurance issues....so maybe don't tell kids.  Invitae company does this for familial panel on genes.  Whole genome testing too but expensive and some folks don't want to know stuff but once it is out there then it is out there.  
-Schedule and track workout with 150 minimum (Yuko says 250) a week + 45 minutes of strength training.  
-Tamari low sodium shoyu good for nuts.  
-eat less cashews since it has lotsa saturated fats which raise LDL?  Chia and Flax seed is better  
-get old labs from Dr. Hoffman and followup and message to Mark Anstadt after blood draw with which facility.  
-my signs are not obvious  
-possible inflammatory arteries due to damage to walls.  Exercise to fix this.

----
MGT of Low Levels of High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol  
-Nonpharmacological intervention: Aerobic exercise, weight loss, nutrition (fruits, veggies, nuts, fish (fast food), smoking cessation, alcohol intake   
-Pharmacological intervention: increase Niacin, Fibrates?, Statins (already), Oral Antidiabetic agents (metformin to jardiance)  

REF: https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000443

### 2.8.22 Search of "PCSK9 inhibitor medications" news articles    
-New treatments could help people hesitant towards statins.  "Do what statins couldn't".  Based on research of gene called PCSK9 new drug 2022.  People with non functioning PCSK9 gene have naturally low levels of unhealthy LDL cholesterol.  Previous targetted PCSK9 gene proved ineffective in 2015 due to high cost and the need for new injections at two week intervals.  New options cheaper: FDA gave approval for an RNA therapy that blocks the gene with a twice yearly injection and another blocks the protein with an oral pill.  Also CRISPR one dose therapy using a protein called Cas9.  
-Can statins cause type 2 diabetes?  
-`Want PCSK9 inhibitors.  First PCSK9 inhibitor monoclonal antibodies called Repatha ($476 a month but can be cheaper, $60 bucks for 2 injectors) and Praluent (not covered by afspa, express scripts) were approved by FDA in 2015 but high cost and require self-injection every two weeks.  Now inhibitors being developed that could cost less act longer and maybe orally.`  
-FDA approved Novartis Leqvio RNA therapy injected twice a year reduce LDL by 52% costs is $3250 per dose so $9759 in year one followed by $6500 each year after, 3 doses first year and 2 doses after that each year.  Merck&Co.'s MK-0616 peptide in phase 1 clinical trials can be oral.  Verve Therapeutics Verve-101 gene therapy can permanently maybe lower LDL with a single dose.  

### 2.5.22 Lipoprotein(a) notes from various  

-Lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a) is a protein that transports cholesterol in the blood.  An LDL particle. High levels of Lp(a) in the blood can increase the likelihood of plaques or blood clots forming in the arteries.  
-Lp(a) test is not a routine test.  Doc may ask for full lipid panel test which checks for cholesterol and triglyceride may ask for fast and only h20.  
-some say levels about 25-30 mg/dl may increase risk but definitely 50 mg/dl or >125 nmol/L.  Normal is under 25 or 30 or <75 nmol/L  
-How to reduce?  Usually genetics so hard.  Medications that inhibit **PCSK9** may reduce Lp(a) levels PCSK9 inhibitor MEDS new in 2015 shown to reduce but more study.  Lipoprotein apheresis is a procedure similar to dialysis.  A machine separates cholesterol from blood plasma and removes the Lp(a) and LDL cholesterol from the blood required weekly or biweekly.  Harborview Medical Center Apheresis Department per https://thefhfoundation.org/fh-treatments/lipoprotein-apheresis  
-Lp(a) test is usually done once, becuase it's pretty constant across your lifetime.  Some exceptions like after menopause cuz Lp(a) levels increase as estrogen levels drop (estrogen good to reduce Lp(a))  
-Supplements: Niacin or vitamin B3, CoQ10, Tumeric  
-Do I have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) too?  In 2020, number of Lp(a) lowering meds in clinical trials now and will see outcomes in next few years.  REF: https://thefhfoundation.org/lipoprotein-a-5-things  
-Lipoprotein(a) is a sticky version of LDL cholesterol which is genetic so cures for this is important.  L-Lysine and L-Proline bind to LP(a) to remove into liver so high vitamin C and amino acid lysine.  
-Heart general advice: avoid trans fat; reduce saturated fat, increase intake of fruits, vegetable, whole grains.  "Unfortunately, their conclusions, if taken to heart, leave consumers to rely on genetics and fate to avoid coronary heart disease - an unacceptable situation given the fact that the scientific literature contains so many studies that point to benefit for omega-3 fatty acids," MacKay said.  
-CT scan and calcium buildup bad  Prothrombin: Time test to see how long blood clots.  Inherited clotting tendencies.
Young heart attack or stroke may indicate the presence of THROMBOPHILIA.  The 2nd most common inherited version is referred to as Prothrombin Mutation via thrombophiliac.com/prothrombin-mutation.  *but maybe not the case cuz doesn't buildup? Next Anticoagulant aka blood thinners work by inhibiting clotting factors.  Antiplatelets inhibit enzymes that cause platelets to clump together.*    
-A few specialist from link above (family heart foundation).  `Jessica Durham ARNP @ The Polyclinic 904 7th Avenue 206.860.4669 or 206.860.2269; Diane Osborn ARNP, CLS @ Clinical Lipidology Virginia Mason 1100 9th Ave 206.223.6624 or 206.223.2313; Drew Baldwin MD @ Cardiology Virginia Mason 206.341.1111; Savitha Subramanian MD @ UW Medicine, Clinical Lipidology 325 9th Ave;`      

### 2.4.22 Seattle Times article about Cody Pickett regarding heart disease  
-41 yr.  Started with coronary calcium scan -an x-ray test that detects calcium-containing plaque in the arteries.  Good to help DRs. ID coronary artery disease before onslaught signs and symptoms.  A score between 100 and 300 indicates moderate plaque deposits with relative high risk over the next three to five years.  Cody's score was 1600.    
-Next a CT scan followed by a coronary angiogram.    
-Dr. Bill Lombardi at UW Medical Center one of the best in the country at placing coronary stents.  May be a solution other than open heart surgery.  
&  
Elevated Lipoprotein(a): Is it a Long-Sought Treatment Finally on the Way?  
-Lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a) is a distinctive particle with two components: a lipoprotein core that resembles LDL, along with a shell that contains apolipoprotein(a) or apo(a).    
-Elevated blood **Lp(a)** levels are primary due to genetic variations in the LPA gene that encodes for apo(a) and cannot be lowered by diet, exercise, or current lipid-lowering therapies.  
-Culprit for therapy with statins or other lipid lowering medications.  The **culprit** is a very high level of Lp(a)  
-Normal Lp(a) considered to be less than 25 mg/dL with significant risk of atherothrombotic events begin at levels between 50 and 70 mg/dL.  
-Some statins can actually slightly raise Lp(a) levels.  
-**Approach that furthest along involves antisense oligonucleotide **(ASO)** therapy.  Focus of newly launched international phase 3 trial with Cleveland Clinic.  
-Participants will have established coronary artery disease and fall into >= 70 mg/dL and >= 90 mg/dL  
-study completion expected at 2024.

### 1.26.22 Talked Joel UW Pulmonary  
-He said it's not showing up in my record and usually does if receive a referral so make sure using correct numbers  
-Pulmonary FAX again is 206.598.3621 BUT central coordinator who will forward to right place and is digital is 206.744.1999.  I can confirm by calling the Pulmonary dept. and choose "2" to get to the Pulmonary office  

### 1.11.22 Message from Sound Family Health  
-Nicole Waite stated that the initial referral was faxed on 11.30.21 but will resend on 1.11.22  

### 1.11.22 Called UW Medicine  
-Spoke to Aida and she talked to the Pulmonary dept. who said they did not receive a fax  
-Will let Dr. Hoffman know to send fax to 206.598.3621  

### 12.22.21 Called UW Medicine for referral  
-Called 206.598.4615 which is Pulmonary dept. per Pam.  Location is 1959 NE Pacific St.?    
-Told Pam that I didn't hear back regarding a Lipid test referral and potential shot  
-The notes we're `Lipid clinic referral for rapid advancing coronary disease on maximum medical therapy`  
-Could not reach Pulmonary dept. so Pam sent a note with my record #U5500229 & Referral FAX # 206.598.3621

### 12.21.21 Telecon with Lincoln Smith PAC
-update my medical and optionally vitamins in mychart\
-Issues (more hardening or calcification or buildup) could be due to pre-diabetes or genetics.  Lincoln will reach out to Dr. Penn for an APO or Apple B check.  Calcification works on the outside and then moves inwards.  Early stage is soft.\
-Blockage ~60% cannot be opened up with stent until 80-90%\
-Concerns with kidney injury, radiation for angiogram & message below  
-HbA10 hemaglobin test every 6 months if you have diabetes.  Lincoln thanks for the message you left on my phone.  I do have a question, Am I considered disabled or do I have a disability?  I notice this is a question listed in job applications with heart disease listed   

### 12 2021 Notes and Questions put together for Lincoln (which some not really answered)
-Three main arteries in the heart with Right Coronary Artery (RCA) my issue and Left Coronary Artery to 2?  Left Anterior Descending Artery (LAD) aka _**Widowmaker**_  
-Qs to ask:  
-Am I considered disabled? I didn't ask but more or less said I could jog.  Said I wasn't restricted from travel for work  
-Using CT scans for checking arteries but said depending on situation.  I guess catheterization is better except for kidney issues and radiation as mentioned above  
-I mentioned that my LDL is low but HDL constantly low.  I eat fish, exercise, and not overweight  
-I mentioned maybe residual plaque moving through body after new meds maybe that is why new build up but no answer to this  
-Ask if jogging is OK and probably but Lincoln will follow up with Dr. Penn
