### 2006  
Sept. 10 2006: Kinda weird.  I was feeling kind of ill and I wake up late.  Pop kicks my bed and asks if I feel OK since it is 0800 and Im still at home.  We're all living together with Aunty Linda's family.  I have 3 cousins now?  See them coming out of a room crying all the time.  So walk in and tell them to stop fighting and crying because it's hurting the family.  Ma says yeah cant u see Uncle Larry, gotta find how to have him take ma somewhere.  I'm also concerned about school since I skipped some classes and I think I'm going to flunk again.  

Sept. 11 2006: FIrst part I'm back to our home on Date st.  Pass the Rozewski house and say "adios" to the gang in there who are sleeping.  Not sure what I'm doing down there in that area but looking for something.  Move onto a cold place with escalators.  I'm at the top of one set of escalators encased partially in ice.  I try to pretent I'm sleeping/dead so noone attacks me.  I see Eric Inouye and feign sleep.  Then I steal his case of dented frappucino cans.  A creature lurks around so I need to be vigilant, something starts chomping on my ice covered legs to help free me?
