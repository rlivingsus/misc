## Dreams and Stories (newer up top)  

### 2006  
Sept. 10 2006: Kinda weird.  I was feeling kind of ill and I wake up late.  Pop kicks my bed and asks if I feel OK since it is 0800 and Im still at home.  We're all living together with Aunty Linda's family.  I have 3 cousins now?  See them coming out of a room crying all the time.  So walk in and tell them to stop fighting and crying because it's hurting the family.  Ma says yeah cant u see Uncle Larry, gotta find how to have him take ma somewhere.  I'm also concerned about school since I skipped some classes and I think I'm going to flunk again.  

Sept. 11 2006: FIrst part I'm back to our home on Date st.  Pass the Rozewski house and say "adios" to the gang in there who are sleeping.  Not sure what I'm doing down there in that area but looking for something.  Move onto a cold place with escalators.  I'm at the top of one set of escalators encased partially in ice.  I try to pretent I'm sleeping/dead so noone attacks me.  I see Eric Inouye and feign sleep.  Then I steal his case of dented frappucino cans.  A creature lurks around so I need to be vigilant, something starts chomping on my ice covered legs to help free me?  

Sept. 12 2006: First with some lady and setting it on then you know what happens.  Then go to vegas type place where its also like Sasebo Lodge.  I'm hurrying back to my room cuz someone is following me.  Rust but not run, fumble for my key.  Get in turn on the lights in a barron? room.  Then go to a place Thailand/Jamaica where I ride a beatup truck with someone with dreadlocks.  In the back of the pickup swaying around and spitting at street vendors (not me but other guys in the truck).  It's the wet festival too.  Stop by a Border's book store where they give small packets of hashish? Say no can do then say that in Singapore you get executed but a singapore girls with a shirt says no with that small amount.  An alarm goes off like a store alarm but it's my clock.  

Story, Frat Times: There are some things in life that should not have to be witnessed by anyone on this earth. My brother was on of these people who bore witness to these things. -He had an uncanny ability to sense events that were about to happen. -Strange habit of going on his own talking to himself wasn't sure but it seemed like our parents were afraid of him too. -battle of good vs. evit not only conducted in earth but in heavens before people even arrived on earth. -my place was to be the balance of good against my brother's evil. -at a young age, caught animals uncannily with his bare hands and took pleasure in squeezing these creatures to death with his hands. I had a similar effect to animals who loved me and freely came to me. I froliced with the creatures but never harmed them. Persuasion of my brother was out of the question. I stayed away as much as I could when wilderness was in view for I knew what was coming. -As young 1st graders he knew how to be cruel and laugh at his classmates bad fortune.  Scissors in the eye...did he do that.  I comforted them as he laughed to the principal's office. -We grew further and further apart with age.  The evil that seemed to consume him made me fearful of him yet he was still my brother and I could not hate him or hide from him as my other relatives seemed to do.  -I joined law enforcement, army or medical field job to help.  Reign in my brother as the serial killer he bbecame. A serial killer against handicap. Trust? is that killer is actually good for easing the passing of people close to death.
