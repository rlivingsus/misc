-Relay attack is a form of MitM attack but not to be confused with the more well-known replay attack.  MitM attacks consist of controlling the back and forth communications between two parties.  
-Note that a REPLAY attack is where for ex., an attacker captures the signal for a keyless remote to open a door lock in order to replay it later when the victim is not home.
-The relay attack is where an attacker relays COMMS from one legitimate device to another legitimate device without the knowledge of the transmitter beyond the engineered device's distance limitations.  An ex. Is an attacker captures the RF signal of a nearby key-fob and forwards it to an accomplice near the targetted vehicle to unlock the car.  This was used in London to steal a Tesla in under 30 seconds.  This is often done by spoofing the lock or car lock.
