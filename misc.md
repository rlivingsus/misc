### Formula for constructive criticism (leadership):
1) introduction with credibility building.  To be taken seriously.  Introduce yourself, it should be rlated to your upcoming criticism.  This becomes optional if the person knows you
2) compliment (optional).  To smooth the blow but optional since some people doesn't like this.
3) criticism.  If you're giving an opinion say so.  If your criticism is based on fact, give your source.  Overall dont use any negative adjectives, adverbs, or expression cuz they increase the chances person becomes defensive and not listen.
4) suggested improvement.  Easier for recipient to improve.
5) how to follow up with you.  Business card.

### GM: Gross Margin.  Lose money on any deal below 30% GM.  For my situation in 2021, the funding request was $307,000 + 20% (DSC work) = $368,400.  Determining increase use this formula (368,400-120,000)/120,000 x 100 = 206% BUT to determine a profit margin eg. [160,000 (client paid)- 84,000 (costs)]/160,000 x 100 = 47.5% (minus this % to see profit margin which is at 47.5%)

What are 5 ways to avoid unnecessary arguments?
Understand that:
-The universe works that way. Everyone has opinions, so no one is technically right; we all just formulate our own truths.
-Your opinions, no matter how factual or impartial, will always trigger someone else one way or another.
-Listen more intently, judge less, but perceive internally.
-Embrace silence and solitude rather than divisiveness and close-headedness. Sometimes peace is better than being right.
-Consider if the other party is rational enough to embrace a second opinion about the topic. If not, leave.
-Continue indulging in your important tasks. Time is too valuable to waste on something draining.
Bonus:
If the argument isn’t a life-or-death situation, ignore it. It’s unimportant.
